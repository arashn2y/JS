# Project Name

## Prerequisites

Before starting, please ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

1. **Check Node.js version**: You need Node.js installed (v12 or higher is recommended). You can check the installed version by running the following command:

   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

2. **Check npm version**: You also need npm to install the required dependencies. Check the installed version of npm by running:
   ```bash
   npm -v
   ```

If Node.js or npm is not installed, the tests may not run as expected.

## Installation

Once you have verified Node.js and npm are installed, follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arashn2y/js.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd js
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Completing the Functions

Before running the tests, make sure to complete all the required functions in the **script.js** file. Each function must pass the corresponding test in the test suite. Refer to the comments in **script.js** for the expected behavior of each function.

> **Tip:** Make sure to import/export the functions correctly to ensure the tests run as expected.

## Running Tests

This project uses **Jest** for testing. You can run the tests by executing the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

Or, if you prefer using Jest directly:

```bash
npm jest
```

## Additional Information

- Feel free to customize the `scripts` section in `package.json` for running Jest or other tools as needed.
- For any further issues, consult the documentation or raise an issue in this repository.
